1. At some point in your childhood, you and your friends went outside to play together for the last time and nobody knew it.

2. I believe all children have prodigy-like skill hidden within in them but rarely does it get noticed or facilitated early in life. School comes first in our society but schools don't give a shit about your individuality, it doesn't give a shit about your weaknesses, it drills you until you can show the teacher at least a 5/10. We call this education, if we stopped putting kids in factory like environments of knowledge and observed them from their youth we would change the world for good.
